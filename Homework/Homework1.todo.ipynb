    "This homework is designed to introduce you to using Jupyter Notebooks.  You'll only have one Notebook to send in, but this homework is designed to give you an opportunity to get the required infrastructure setup and to start working with the notebooks.  We'll have fairly simple operators that'll be required to be used\n",

    "When reading these notebooks, remember to pay attention to the output that I'm providing to you.  The types are the most important, not so much the number.  Also, try to take in account the format of your notebook (structure), and the naming of your variables.  These components won't be weighted heavily this time around, but it's good practice.\n",

We'll cover exceptions a bit more in-depth in module 3, but to get better marks on your homework, it's important to resolve those issues.

Don't fix this issue yet, but run the below cell and pay attention to the output and what it's telling you.
